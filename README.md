# Etcsv Stats

EtCsv Stats is an open-source tool designed to help you make sense of your sales on Etsy. You can review associated fees and taxes on any order, understand how many products sold, see your actual net income after fees and taxes, and see who your top customers are by number of orders and total spend.
