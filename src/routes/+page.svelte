				EtCsv stats will generate views based on files you upload from Etsy;<br />
				However, it cannot be guaranteed that these numbers are 100% accurate. In cases where your shop
				is based internationally, your listing fees may fluctuate based on your local currency‚Äôs conversion
				rate to USD, and EtCsv Stats does not account for these fluctuations.<br />
				Additionally, Etsy themselves may change their fees mid-year, which this tool may not have updated
				for at the time you use it. There may also be differences in how sums are rounded. EtCsv Stats
				is not liable for your use of the data displays generated from your uploaded files.

	<h2 class="h2">How does it work?</h2>
	<p>
		You will download files provided by Etsy for your Etsy shop, then
		<a href="/files" class="anchor">upload them</a>
		into EtCsv Stats. EtCsv Stats will then generate different views for this data to help you better
		understand your fees, your top-selling products, and your top-buying customers. Refer to the guide
		on the upload page to learn which files you need from EtCsv and how to download them.
